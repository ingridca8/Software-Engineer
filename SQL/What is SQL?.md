# SQL
SQL or Structured Query Language is a critical tool for data professionals. It is undoubtedly the most important language for getting a job in the field of data analysis or data sciences.

Millions of data points are being generated every minute and raw data does not have any story to tell. After all this data gets stored in databases and professionals use SQL to extract this data for further analysis. 

A database is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured into tables. Tables can grow large and have a multitude of columns and records.

Spreadsheets, like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, allow you to view and manipulate data directly: with selecting, filtering, sorting, etc. By applying a number of these operations you can obtain the subset of data you are seeking.

SQL (pronounced “S-Q-L” or “sequel”) allows you to write queries which define the subset of data you are seeking. Unlike Excel and Sheets, your computer and SQL will handle how to get the data; you can focus on what data you would like. You can save these queries, refine them, share them, and run them on different databases.

It is a great way to access data and a great entry point to programming because its syntax (the specific vocabulary that gives instructions to the computer) is very human-readable. Without knowing any SQL, you might still be able to guess what each command will do.
