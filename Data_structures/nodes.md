# Nodes
## What are nodes?
Fudamental building blocks of many computer science data structures.
An individual node contains data and links to other nodes. Each one adds additional constraints or behavior to these features to create the desired structure. 
The link or links within the node are sometimes referred to as pointers. This is because they “point” to another node.
Typically, data structures implement nodes with one or more links. If these links are null, it denotes that you have reached the end of the particular node or link path you were previously following.
