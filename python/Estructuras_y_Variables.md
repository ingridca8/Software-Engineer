## Variables
Las variables son elementos fundamentales en la programación. Son espacios en la memoria de la computadora que se utilizan para almacenar y manipular datos. 

En Python, las variables se usan para almacenar valores que pueden ser utilizados en diferentes partes del programa. Al asignar un valor a una variable, se le da un nombre y se reserva un espacio en la memoria para almacenar ese valor. Luego, se puede acceder a ese valor utilizando el nombre de la variable.

A variable is used to store data that will be used by the program. This data can be a number, a string, a Boolean, a list or some other data type. Every variable has a name which can consist of letters, numbers, and the underscore character _.

The equal sign = is used to assign a value to a variable. After the initial assignment is made, the value of a variable can be updated to new values as needed.

### Variables names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, grade, grocery_list).

Rules for Python variables:

    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character. It cannot start with a number.
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _).
    Variable names are case-sensitive (num, Num, and NUM are three different variables).

### Types of vriables
Built-in Python Data types are:

    Numeric
    Text Type
    Sequence Type (Python list, Python tuple, Python range)
    Boolean
    Set
    Dictionary

## Estructuras
Structures represent a "named" collection of related data. For anything in a computer more complicated than a list of numbers, structures can be used. For example, to represent any given car, we might want to know how many doors it has, if it has AC, what its max speed is, etc. All of this information relates to a single "Car" entity, and should be saved in a computer using a structure data type. We use the "DOT" notation to access a structure stored in a variable, thus, car.max_speed, car.number_of_doors, car.ac, are all valid references to a structure. 

 A Structure is one of the 5 data types in programming. A structure is used to represent information about something more complicated than a single number, character, or boolean can do (and more complicated than an array of the above data types can do). For example, a Student can be defined by his or her name, gpa, age, uid, etc. Each of these pieces of information should be labeled with an easily understood descriptive title, and then combined to form a whole (the structure).

### Structures vs objects
Structures (found in Matlab and C) and Objects (found in C++, Java, ActionScript, etc) are mostly the same thing. The both contain named data fields. Objects also contain functions to manipulate the data inside of the object. In C and Matlab, functions must be created separately to manipulate the data inside an object. 

### Structures in python
Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. Data Structures allows you to organize your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly.  

#### Types of Data Structures in Python

Python has implicit support for Data Structures which enable you to store and access data. These structures are called List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.

Python allows its users to create their own Data Structures enabling them to have full control over their functionality. The most prominent Data Structures are Stack, Queue, Tree, Linked List and so on which are also available to you in other programming languages. So now that you know what are the types available to you, why don’t we move ahead to the Data Structures and implement them using Python.
