# Programming paradigms
The term programming paradigm refers to a style of programming. It does not refer to a specific language, but rather it refers to the way you program.

There are lots of programming languages that are well-known but all of them need to follow some strategy when they are implemented. And that strategy is a paradigm.

## Imperative programming paradigms

The paradigm consists of several statements, and after the execution of all of them, the result is stored. Itâ€™s about writing a list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step.

In an imperative programming paradigm, the order of the steps is crucial, because a given step will have different consequences depending on the current values of variables when the step is executed.

### Procedural programming paradigm

Procedural programming (which is also imperative) allows splitting those instructions into procedures.

**NOTE**: Procedures aren't functions. The difference between them is that functions return a value, and procedures do not. More specifically, functions are designed to have minimal side effects, and always produce the same output when given the same input. Procedures, on the other hand, do not have any return value. Their primary purpose is to accomplish a given task and cause a desired side effect.

A great example of procedures would be the well known for loop. The for loop's main purpose is to cause side effects and it does not return a value.

Languages that support the procedural programming paradigm are:

  + C
  +  C++
  +  Java
  +  ColdFusion
  +  Pascal
