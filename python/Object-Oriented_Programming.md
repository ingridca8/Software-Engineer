# Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a software development approach that focuses on defining and sculpting named classes as entities with attributes and behaviors. One key benefit of object-oriented programming? It makes reusing and maintaining code easier. 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). 

## Building blocks of object-oriented programming 

The object-oriented programming paradigm uses the following building blocks to structure an application: 

### Classes 

Classes are user-defined data types used as a blueprint or template for the objects a software program will use in its operation. Classes define the methods and attributes that each object created from them has. Most object-oriented programming languages use classes, though some (like Go, for example) do not. 

### Objects 

In an object-oriented language that uses classes, objects are instances of those classes created with specific data. 

### Methods 

Methods are functions stated inside a class that define the behavior of the objects created from the class. They perform actions like returning information about the object or modifying the data contained in the object. 

### Attributes 

Attributes are variables defined inside a class that describe what data the objects created from the class will contain.
